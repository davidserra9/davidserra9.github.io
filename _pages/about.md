Hola! I am David Serrano-Lozano (see Fig. 1).

I am a PhD Student at the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es/), [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html), based in Barcelona, Spain. I am advised by [Prof. Javier Vazquez-Corral](https://pages.cvc.uab.es/jvazquezcorral/) and [Dr. Luis Herranz](http://www.lherranz.org/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Low-Level Computer Vision, Generative Models and Computational Photography. I am paticularly focused on making models more interpretable and understandable. 

I earned my [M.Sc. in Computer Vision](https://mcv.uab.cat/) from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html) where I received honors for my master’s thesis on "Uncertainty as a Proxy of the Generalization Error for Marine Species Identification" advised by [Dr. David Masip](https://aiwell.uoc.edu/~dmasipr/). Previously, I obtained a [B.Sc. in Telecommunication Networks Engineering](https://telecos.upc.edu/ca) from [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en), where I completed my bachelor's thesis on "Automatic Detection of Visible Events in Fusion Reactors" advised by [Prof. J. Ramon Morros](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/josep-ramon-morros). During my M.Sc. I spent two years at [Ctrl4Enviro](https://ctrl4enviro.com/), managing the research and development of efficient computer vision models deployed on NVIDIA edge-computing embedded systems.
